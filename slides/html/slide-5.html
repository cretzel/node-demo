<h3>Event-driven asynchronous callbacks</h3>

<ul>

<div class="bordered code"><pre>
var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
console.log("Hello World");
</pre></div>

<li>In node.js there is only one single process. If there is a slow database query somewhere in this process, this affects the whole process - everything comes to a halt until the slow query has finished. </li>
</ul>
