<h3>Event-driven asynchronous callbacks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many client connections can be handled concurrently.</li>
<li> Node tells the operating system (through epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll, or select) that it should be notified when a new connection is made, and then it goes to sleep.</li>
<li> If someone new connects, then it executes the callback. Each connection is only a small heap allocation.</li>
</ul>
