<h3>Event-driven asynchronous callbacks</h3>

<ul>

<div class="bordered code"><pre>
database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable", function(rows) {
  var result = rows;
});
console.log("Hello World");
</pre></div>

<li>Now, Node.js can handle the database request asynchronously. Provided that database.query() is part of an asynchronous library</li>
<li>Instead of waiting for it to be finished, it's executed asynchronously and the callback is executed when it's finished.</li>
<li>Then, it immediately executes console.log(), and afterwards, it enters the event loop. Node.js continuously cycles through this loop again and again whenever there is nothing else to do, waiting for events. Events like, e.g., a slow database query finally delivering its results. </li>

</ul>
